# AChemS Codefest 2023

## What is the NHANES Codefest?

The goal of the Codefest is for you to apply your programming skills, learn from others, get feedback, explore others' work, and connect with the larger AChemS community. This codefest will focus on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We will provide starter code, orient you to the available datasets, and provide a team of teachers as support for working in both R and Python. We welcome coders of all skill levels and from any chemosensory system!

This is inspired by the great project over at [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

## What is NHANES?

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The survey is unique in that it combines interviews and physical examinations. The 2013-2014 dataset included measures of smell and taste as well as demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-related questions. The examination component consists of medical, dental, and physiological measurements, as well as laboratory tests administered by highly trained medical personnel.

## In person events at AChemS 2023

Orientation: Wednesday, April 19th at 4 pm (Great Egret): Learn about the NHANES dataset. We will provide sample code and access to the smell and taste datasets. More NHANES datasets can be downloaded to examine how smell and taste interact with other metrics. The goal is to visualize the data–anything from reproducing a graph to an interactive app.

Code with friends and the teaching staff on the back deck of the Hyatt, starting at 9pm. Please bring your own laptop! 

Show your work: Thursday, April 20th at 5 pm (Calusa ABC): Present your best result—you will have two minutes to present one graph.

## Guidelines 
(modified from [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) )

We welcome all newcomers, enthusiasts, and experts to participate, but be mindful of a few things:
1. This is NOT about criticizing the original dataset. Focus on the provided dataset, learning, and improving your visualization techniques.
2. This is NOT about criticizing or tearing down your fellow #AChemSCodefest practitioners or their code! Be supportive and kind to each other! Like other's posts and help promote the #AChemSCodefest community!
3. Use the hashtag #AChemSCodefest if you create your own version and would like to share it.
4. Include a picture of the visualization when you post on social media.
5. Include a copy of the code used to create your visualization when you post to social media. Comment your code wherever possible to help yourself and others understand your process!
6. Focus on improving your craft, even if you end up with something simple!
7. Give credit to the original data source whenever possible.
